CircleCI is a popular platform for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). It allows software teams to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. This CircleCI pipeline description file sets up a CI/CD process for a full-stack application with both a frontend and backend component.

Orbs
Orbs in CircleCI are packages of jobs, commands, and executors that can be shared across multiple CircleCI projects. Orbs provide pre-packaged, reusable config that helps simplify setup and improve consistency across projects.

In this pipeline description file, the following orbs are used:

node: An orb that helps with Node.js installation.
eb: An orb that helps with Elastic Beanstalk deployment.
aws-cli: An orb that helps with AWS CLI setup.
Jobs
Jobs in CircleCI are defined sequences of steps that carry out specific tasks. Jobs can run in parallel or in a specific order, depending on the pipeline definition.

Build Job
The build job is responsible for building both the frontend and backend components of the application. This job is defined with the following steps:

Node.js installation: The node/install step installs the specified version of Node.js (14.15).
Code checkout: The checkout step checks out the code from the repository.
Frontend dependencies installation: The step runs the command npm run frontend:install to install dependencies in the frontend app using the root level package.json file.
Backend API dependencies installation: The step runs the command npm run api:install to install dependencies in the backend API.
Frontend lint: The step runs the command npm run frontend:lint to lint the frontend code.
Frontend build: The step runs the command npm run frontend:build to build the frontend code.
API build: The step runs the command npm run api:build to build the backend API.
Deploy Job
The deploy job is responsible for deploying both the frontend and backend components of the application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, after manual approval. This job is defined with the following steps:

Node.js installation: The node/install step installs the specified version of Node.js (14.15).
Elastic Beanstalk setup: The eb/setup step sets up Elastic Beanstalk.
AWS CLI setup: The aws-cli/setup step sets up the AWS CLI.
Code checkout: The checkout step checks out the code from the repository.
Deployment: The step runs the commands npm run frontend:deploy and npm run api:deploy to deploy both the frontend and backend components of the app.
Workflow
A workflow in CircleCI defines the order of jobs to run in a pipeline. Workflows can specify conditions for running jobs, such as only running a job on specific branches.

In this pipeline description file, the workflow named udagram defines the order of jobs to run: first, the build job, then a hold step that requires manual approval, and finally the deploy job. The hold step is only applied to the main branch.
